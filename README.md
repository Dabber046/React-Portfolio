## Overview

This project is designed to:
- Demonstrate a modular folder structure for React applications.
- Include reusable components like headers and footers.
- Use `react-router-dom` for route-based navigation.
- Serve static assets like images through Vite's efficient bundling.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A modern frontend tooling framework for faster builds and development.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language for better code quality.
- **React Router**: Library for declarative routing in React.
- **CSS**: For styling components.
